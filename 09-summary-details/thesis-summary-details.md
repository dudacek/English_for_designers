## Article

In the campaign, I tried to present Marek Hilšer as an attractive candidate. A candidate with comprehensive communication, a profiled election program, and an original language. I managed to meet the challenge in the form of a sophisticated part of the campaign intended for the target group of first-time voters and students. At the same time, I managed to maintain a unified communication containing a large amount of information. Even in cases where he speaks to different constituencies.
